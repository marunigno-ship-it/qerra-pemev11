# Planetary Energy Mastery Ethical Vector (PEMEV-11)

**QAI PROJECT / QERRA Hybrid Algorithm - Vector 11**  
Open-source ethical guidance framework for hybrid/quantum humanoids toward Kardashev Type I civilization.

### Purpose
PEMEV-11 establishes an accurate scientific baseline for humanity's progress to Type I planetary energy mastery (~1.74 × 10¹⁷ W benchmark).  
It calculates current Kardashev level (~0.73 in 2025) and projects realistic pathways (renewables, fusion, orbital solar, Mars ISRU).

Built to integrate with QERRA remorse horizons and W-state robustness in future vectors — ensuring only fair, sustainable, remorse-free paths are recommended.

### Current Status (Dec 29 2025)
- Baseline phase complete  
- Realistic projections added (10×, 1000×, full Type I scenarios)  
- Pure Python (numpy) — verifiable by anyone

### How to Run
```bash
pip install numpy
python pemev11_with_projections.py
