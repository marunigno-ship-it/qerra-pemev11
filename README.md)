# Planetary Energy Mastery Ethical Vector (PEMEV-11)

**QAI PROJECT / QERRA Hybrid Algorithm - Vector 11**  
Open-source ethical guidance framework for hybrid/quantum humanoids toward Kardashev Type I civilization.

### Purpose
PEMEV-11 establishes an accurate scientific baseline for humanity's progress to Type I planetary energy mastery (~1.74 × 10¹⁷ W benchmark).  
It calculates current Kardashev level (~0.73 in 2025), projects realistic pathways (renewables, fusion, orbital solar, Mars ISRU), and applies ethical scoring to recommend/reject paths based on equity and sustainability.

Built to integrate with QERRA remorse horizons and W-state robustness — ensuring only fair, sustainable, remorse-free paths are recommended.

### Current Status (Dec 31 2025)
- Baseline + projections complete  
- Ethical scoring layer v2 added (adjustable weights/threshold)  
- Supports fast breakthroughs if ethics high  
- Pure Python (numpy) — verifiable by anyone

### How to Run
```bash
pip install numpy
python pemev11_ethical_v2.py  # Latest with ethical evaluations
