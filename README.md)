# Planetary Energy Mastery Ethical Vector (PEMEV-11)

**QAI PROJECT / QERRA Hybrid Algorithm - Vector 11**  
Open-source ethical guidance framework for hybrid/quantum humanoids toward Kardashev Type I civilization.

### Purpose
PEMEV-11 establishes an accurate scientific baseline for humanity's progress to Type I planetary energy mastery (~1.74 × 10¹⁷ W benchmark).  
It calculates current Kardashev level (~0.73 in 2025), projects realistic pathways, applies ethical scoring to recommend/reject paths based on equity/sustainability, and integrates remorse horizons with W-state robustness for multi-stakeholder alignment.

Ensuring only fair, sustainable, remorse-free paths.

### Current Status (Jan 03 2026)
- Baseline + projections complete  
- Ethical scoring v2 (adjustable weights/threshold)  
- Real-world hints (current path REJECT)  
- W-state robustness bonus (classical simulation)  
- Visualization with auto-save  
- Pure Python (numpy/matplotlib) — verifiable

### How to Run
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
python pemev11_full_visual.py  # Latest with visualization
